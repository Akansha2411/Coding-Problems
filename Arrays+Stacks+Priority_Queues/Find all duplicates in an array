Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

Example:
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3] */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        int flag = 0;vector<int> res;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
        {
            nums[abs(nums[i])-1]*=-1; //there is a relation between array indices and array elements.
            if(nums[abs(nums[i])-1]>0) //for duplicates,te elements will be multiplied by -1 twice,hence positive.
            {
               // flag = 1;
                res.push_back(abs(nums[i]));
                
            };
        }
        return res;
    }
};
